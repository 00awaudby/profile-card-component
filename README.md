## My process
The process was as folows, i built out the html first using the markup provided, i then added the classes i needed for the styling , next i styled the project and added the state classes for hover and focus states.

The final step was to add the javascript for the buttons and the compoent to work , i also added in a error message that will show if you submit with selecting a rating number.
